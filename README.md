About this code
---------------

[PyGame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
is a widely-used, widely-deployed interactive graphics library.
It supports interactive 2D graphics with minimum "boilerplate" 
(necessary, typically redundant, and sometimes voluminous) code,
positioned especially for learning to write games (including
[migration tutorials](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/from-scratch.html)
from 
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)), but also of more general use.

This code extends PyGame Zero to support multitouch and (hopefully)
a growing variety of sensors, embedded displays, and actuators
used in a variety of 
[XR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality) 
("extended reality") -- e.g., VR, AR, and 
[tangible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangible_user_interface), 
embedded, and embodied interaction 
([TEI](https://tei.acm.org/2022/about/about/)) -- interactions.
