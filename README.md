About this code
---------------

[PyGame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
is a widely-used, widely-deployed interactive graphics library.
It supports interactive 2D graphics with minimum "boilerplate" 
(necessary, typically redundant, and sometimes voluminous) code,
positioned especially for learning to write games (including
migration tutorials from Scratch), but also of more general use.

This code extends PyGame Zero to support multitouch and (hopefully)
a growing variety of sensors, embedded displays, and actuators
used in a variety of XR ("extended reality") -- e.g., VR, AR, and 
tangible, embedded, and emboided interaction (TEI) -- interactions.
